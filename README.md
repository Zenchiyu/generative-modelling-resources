# Generative Modelling resources

This repository contains (top notch) useful resources for image or video generation.

## Videos
- [Diffusion and Score-Based Generative Models | Yang Song](https://youtu.be/wMmqCMwuM2Q); explains many key papers including
    - [Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600)
    - [Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456)
- [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models | Miika Aittala](https://youtu.be/T0Qxzf0eaio); explains at the intuitive level their paper and most importantly, how they make the "flow lines" more straight for faster sampling speed (easier for Euler method).
- [Flow Matching: Simplifying and Generalizing Diffusion Models | Yaron Lipman](https://youtu.be/5ZSwYogAxYg); explains where diffusion models situate compared to flow-based models (or more specifically continuous normalizing flows)
